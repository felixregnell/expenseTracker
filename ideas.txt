Ideas for program features:
  - Create a transaction class that contains all wanted transaction information (date, amount, business), that also has a unique id generated from all the info the bank gives about the transaction (How ensure uniqueness?)
  - Create a date class (implementing some api) with equals method
  - Make possible to format transactions into a cvs file to make loadable into xl
  - use string interpelation instead of + on strings
  - create a nice way to represent 10000 as 10 000 or prehaps 10, 000 (~before for every set of three 0s add a ' ' or ',') 
  - test idea for git push
